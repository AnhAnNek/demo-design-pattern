## The main purpose of creation of this project
I am currently learning about Design Patterns at the university.
This project helps me remember the thing I study more effortlessly. 
Before taking the Design Patterns course,
I had implemented some patterns since my sophomore year (second-year student) in university .
I have applied the Singleton, Builder, Factory Method, and Strategy patterns
in the CompanyManagement (WPF - C#), laptop-mall (JSP Servlet - Java), flash-memorizer (Springboot - Java), and chat-hub (Springboot - Java) projects.
